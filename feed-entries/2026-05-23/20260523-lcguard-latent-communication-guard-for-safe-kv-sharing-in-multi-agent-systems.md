arXiv:2605.22786v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems increasingly rely on intermediate communication to coordinate complex tasks. While most existing systems communicate through natural language, recent work shows that latent communication, particularly through transformer key-value (KV) caches, can improve efficiency and preserve richer task-relevant information. However, KV caches also encode contextual inputs, intermediate reasoning states, and agent-specific information, creating an opaque channel through which sensitive content may propagate across agents without explicit textual disclosure. To address this, we introduce \textbf{LCGuard} (Latent Communication Guard), a framework for safe KV-based latent communication in multi-agent LLM systems. LCGuard treats shared KV caches as latent working memory and learns representation-level transformations before cache artifacts are transmitted across agents. We formalize representation-level sensitive information leakage operationally through reconstruction: a shared cache artifact is unsafe if an adversarial decoder can recover agent-specific sensitive inputs from it. This leads to an adversarial training formulation in which the adversary learns to reconstruct sensitive inputs, while LCGuard learns transformations that preserve task-relevant semantics and reduce reconstructable information. Empirical evaluations across multiple model families and multi-agent benchmarks show that LCGuard consistently reduces reconstruction-based leakage and attack success rates while maintaining competitive task performance compared to standard KV-sharing baselines.
