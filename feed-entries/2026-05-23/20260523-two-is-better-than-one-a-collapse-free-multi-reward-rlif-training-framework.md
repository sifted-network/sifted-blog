arXiv:2605.22620v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning ability of LLMs, but often depends on external supervision from human annotations or gold-standard solutions. Reinforcement learning from internal feedback (RLIF) has recently emerged as a scalable unsupervised alternative, using signals extracted from the model itself. However, existing RLIF methods typically rely on a single internal reward, which can lead to reward hacking, entropy collapse, and degraded reasoning structure. We propose a multi-reward RLIF framework that decomposes the training signal into two complementary components: an answer-level reward based on cluster voting and a completion-level reward based on token-wise self-certainty. To combine these signals robustly, we apply GDPO-based normalization to reduce reward-scale imbalance. We further introduce KL-Cov regularization, which targets low-entropy token distributions responsible for disproportionate entropy reduction, preserving exploration and preventing late-stage collapse. Across mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks, our method improves stability and robustness over prior unsupervised RL approaches, while achieving performance close to supervised RLVR methods. These results show that complementary internal rewards, combined with targeted regularization, can support stable long-horizon reasoning without relying on external ground-truth supervision. Code will be released soon.
